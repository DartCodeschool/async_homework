# Dart Programming Tasks

These tasks are designed to strengthen your understanding of Dart concepts related to async and async file operations.

## Task 1: Basic Async Function

Write a Dart function called `calculateSum` 
that takes in a list of integers and asynchronously calculates their sum. 
Test the function with a sample input list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and print the result.

## Task 2: Async File Reading

Create a Dart program that reads the content of a text file asynchronously. 
Prompt the user to enter the file name, and then display the content of the file on the console.

## Task 3: Async Division

Write a Dart function called `divideNumbers` 
that takes in two integers and performs an asynchronous division operation. 
Handle the case of dividing by zero and print an appropriate error message.

## Task 4: Parallel Execution

Create a Dart program that performs parallel execution of two asynchronous tasks. 
Implement two functions, `task1()` and `task2()`, which simulate time-consuming operations. 
Execute both tasks in parallel and print their results when they complete.

## Task 5: Streamed Numbers

Write a Dart program that asynchronously streams a list of integers after a random delay. 
Implement a function called `streamNumbers` that takes a list of integers as input and streams each number with a delay. 
Print all the streamed numbers on the console.

## Task 6: Error Handling in Async Functions

Design a Dart program that calls an asynchronous function that may throw an exception. 
Implement proper error handling using try-catch and display an appropriate error message if an exception occurs.

## Task 7: Chaining Async Operations

Create a Dart program that performs multiple asynchronous operations sequentially. 
Implement three async functions: `operation1()`, `operation2()`, and `operation3()`. 
Chain these operations together so that each operation is executed only after the previous one completes.

## Task 8: Delayed Execution

Write a Dart program that executes a function after a specific delay. 
Implement a function called `executeDelayed` that takes a function as a parameter and an integer representing the delay in milliseconds. 
The function should execute after the specified delay and print a message on the console.

## Task 9: Async File Handling with Exception Handling

Design a Dart program that reads the content of a text file asynchronously 
and handles any potential exceptions that may occur during the file reading process. 
Prompt the user to enter the file name, and display the content of the file on the console.

## Task 10: Converting Data Types

Create a Dart program that asynchronously converts a list of strings to doubles. 
Implement a function called `convertToDoubles` that takes a list of strings as input, 
converts each string to a double asynchronously, and returns a new list containing the converted values. 
Test the function with a sample input list `["1.5", "2.7", "3.9"]` and print the resulting list.
